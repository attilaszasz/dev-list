            "description": "It is a prototype-based language. The concept of prototyping implies that behavior can be reused by cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes. Every object in JavaScript depends from a prototype which defines a set of functions and members that the object can use. There is no class. Just objects. Every object can then be used as prototype for another object."

Lots of hassles and delays and paperwork. But you don’t have to do code reviews this way – and you shouldn’t."
